# Badger

Badger App handles event registration and creation of badges (for events). Its original purpose was streamline the badge creation process for events we hosted in West Michigan. It has grown in concept based on need.

## Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rake db:setup`
4. Start the server `rails server`

You should be greeted with the homepage. Magic.
